## The Problem: An Airport Flying Blind

Mactan-Cebu International Airport (MCIA) is a world-class gateway, but its operational "nervous system" faces a critical challenge. In their own words, their "biggest daily challenge is real-time decision making" because the vast amount of data they collect is not yet analytically interpreted. This creates a stressful, dual-sided problem:

### Target A: "The Operator, David"
David is an MCIA Duty Manager in the Airport Operation Control Center (AOCC).

**Pain Point:** David's team is constantly reacting to problems that stem from inefficiencies such as sudden long queues or disorganized staff placement. He has a mountain of data but lacks the tools to predict issues before they impact operations.

### Target B: "The Traveler, Anna"
Anna is an international tourist traveling to and from Cebu.

**Pain Points:** 
- **Departure Experience:** "How long is the check-in queue? Where is my gate? Do I have enough time to eat before boarding?"
- **Arrival Experience (NEW):** "How do I get to my hotel in Cebu City? What's the fastest route? Which transportation option is best? How long will it take?"

This uncertainty creates a stressful experience at both ends of the journey, preventing Anna from fully enjoying MCIA's hospitality and efficiently reaching her destination in Cebu.

## Our Solution: Complete Journey Intelligence

We propose **AURA: AI-Powered Unified Resource Assistant**, a predictive intelligence platform that transforms MCIA's raw data into actionable foresight for **the entire travel journey** - from origin to MCIA, and from MCIA to final destination in Cebu.

### AURA has two interconnected parts:

#### 1. AOCC Predictive Layer (For the Operator)
A smart dashboard that acts as the AOCC's predictive command center. Instead of just showing live video feeds, AURA uses Vertex AI Vision via occupancy analytics to count passengers in real-time. It cross-references this with flight manifests (via AIDX integration) to predict queue density 30-60 minutes in advance, giving David and his team the power to see future bottlenecks and prevent them before they form.

**New Feature:** Arrival flow monitoring to predict immigration, baggage claim, and ground transportation demand, enabling proactive resource allocation.

#### 2. MCIA Navigator (For the Traveler)
A sleek mobile companion app that serves as the passenger's personal "Waze for the airport AND Cebu." It now handles **bidirectional travel**:

##### DEPARTURE MODE (MCIA → Airplane)
- **The Commute:** Uses real-time external data (traffic, weather) to provide accurate arrival time estimates at MCIA.
- **Airport Processing:** Provides dynamic, real-time wait time estimates for check-in, security, and immigration.
- **Boarding & Gate:** Guides passengers with accurate walking times and instant alerts for gate changes.
- **Context-Aware Wayfinding:** Eliminates gate anxiety and encourages airport exploration.

##### ARRIVAL MODE (Airplane → MCIA → Cebu Destinations) **[NEW]**
- **Flight Landing:** Tracks flight arrival in real-time and estimates immigration/baggage claim wait times.
- **Ground Transportation Hub:** Integrates with local transportation options (Grab, taxi, private car, shuttle) for destinations in:
  - Lapu-Lapu City
