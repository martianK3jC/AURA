# 🚧 AURA Missing Features Roadmap
*Based on the "AURA: AI-Powered Unified Resource Assistant" Concept Paper*

## 🔴 CRITICAL (The "Unified" Core)
These features connect the two sides of the app, making it a true platform.

- [ ] **Live Queue Sync:** Connect Operator CV outputs (`wait_time`, `queue_length`) to Traveler App Timeline.
- [ ] **Flight API (AIDX):** Fetch real-time Gates, Delays, and Boarding Times.
- [ ] **Traffic/Weather APIs:** Replace simulated commute times with real data.

## 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY (AI & Intelligence)
These features deliver the "AI" promise.

- [ ] **Traveler Chatbot:** Multilingual AI concierge for questions like "Will I miss my connection?".
- [ ] **Operator Query Interface:** Text input for operators to ask "Where should I deploy staff?".
- [ ] **Predictive Alerts:** Backend logic to trigger alerts 30-mins before congestion occurs.

## 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY (Navigation & UX)
These features deliver the "Peace of Mind" promise.

- [ ] **Indoor Maps:** Visual terminal map with "Blue Dot" user location.
- [ ] **Dynamic Walking Times:** Calculate walk time based on current location (e.g., from Restaurant -> Gate).
- [ ] **"Time-to-Board" Calculator:** Dynamic countdown adjusting for walking speed/distance.

## 🔵 LOW PRIORITY (Safety Extensions)
- [ ] **Proactive Weather Alerts:** Push notifications for typhoons/cancellations.
- [ ] **Safety Incident Vision:** Specific CV models for unattended bags/unauthorized access.
